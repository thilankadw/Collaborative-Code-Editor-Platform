# 🧠 Collaborative Code Editor with Agentic AI Analysis

A full-stack MERN + Python (Phidata) project showcasing a real-time collaborative code editor with advanced AI-driven code analysis. This platform enables multiple users to edit the same file simultaneously while offering owner-only GitHub version control and integrated agentic AI support for smart debugging, error detection, and code quality insights.

> 🚀 **This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, real-time communication, AI integration, authentication, and UI/UX design.**

## 🔍 Features

### 💬 Real-Time Collaboration
- Real-time code synchronization using **Socket.IO**
- Multiple users can edit the **same file simultaneously**
- Built-in **Monaco Editor** with enhanced dark theme and syntax highlighting

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- **JWT-based authentication** system to ensure secure user sessions
- Project-level access: only the **owner** can manage version control and GitHub integration

### 🧠 Agentic AI System (via Python + Phidata)
- Smart AI agents analyze code for:
  - 🔍 Error detection
  - 🧹 Code smells
  - 🐞 Bug identification
- Seamless integration with backend to provide **real-time code insights**

### 🗃️ GitHub Integration
- Version control via **SimpleGit**
- Only the project **owner** can push or pull to the GitHub repository

### 💾 Local File Storage

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**
- **Monaco Editor**
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Socket.IO client**
- **JWT Auth flow**

### Backend (Node.js + Python)
- **Express.js**
- **Socket.IO server**

## 🧪 AI Analysis Capabilities (Powered by Phidata)

> The **agentic AI system** empowers the platform to act like a coding assistant:
- Detect and explain syntax errors
- Suggest cleaner refactoring paths
- Highlight inefficient or unsafe code
- Provide AI-driven feedback directly in the editor

---

## 🔐 GitHub Version Control

- The **project owner** can:
  - Connect their GitHub repo
  - Push/pull code using **SimpleGit**
  - Maintain a clean version history of collaboration sessions

- Collaborators:
  - Can view/edit files but cannot access GitHub actions

---

## 📁 File Management

- Save current files locally with automatic backups
- Smooth editing experience with low-latency saving
- Supports multiple tabs or files (based on implementation)

---

## 📷 Screenshots (Optional)

_Add screenshots/gifs of your UI showing collaboration, code analysis, and GitHub sync._
